The `rachio` switch platform allows you to toggle zones connected to your [Rachio irrigation system](http://rachio.com/) on and off.

Once configured, a switch will be added for every zone that is enabled on every controller in the account provided, as well as a switch to toggle each controller's standby mode. 

<p class='note'>
You must have the [Rachio component](/components/rachio/) configured to use this switch.
</p>

To add this platform to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: rachio
```

Configuration variables:

- **manual_run_mins** (*Optional*): For how long, in minutes, to turn on a station when the switch is enabled. Defaults to 10 minutes.

<p class='note'>
**Water-saving suggestion:**<br>
Set `manual_run_mins` to a high maximum failsafe value when using scripts to control zones. If something goes wrong with your script, Home Assistant, or you hit the Rachio API rate limit of 1700 calls per day, the controller will still turn off the zone after this amount of time.
</p>
