The `rachio` binary sensor platform allows you to view the status of your [Rachio irrigation system](http://rachio.com/).

Once configured, a binary sensor will be added that shows whether or not each controller in the account provided is online and reachable by Rachio's servers.

<p class='note'>
	You must have the [Rachio component](/components/rachio/) configured to use this switch.
</p>


To add this platform to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: rachio
```
